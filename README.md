# Next.js Multi-Tenant Blog Application

A production-ready multi-tenant application built with `Next.js` 15, featuring custom subdomains for each tenant.

MDX/markdown processing is handled by `next-mdx-remote-client`.

## Features

- ✅ Custom subdomain routing with Next.js middleware
- ✅ Tenant-specific content and pages
- ✅ Shared components and layouts across tenants
- ✅ Redis for tenant data storage
- ✅ Admin interface for managing tenants
- ✅ Emoji support for tenant branding
- ✅ Support for local development with subdomains
- ✅ Compatible with Vercel preview deployments

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router
- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) for data storage
- Plain CSS with module and postCSS for styling
- Custom design system with radix

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn
- Upstash Redis account (for production)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/talatkuyuk/multi-tenant-blog-app.git
   cd multi-tenant-blog-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

   ```
   KV_REST_API_URL=your_redis_url
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_redis_token
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Main site: http://localhost:3000
   - Admin panel: http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Tenants: http://[tenant-name].localhost:3000

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

This application demonstrates a subdomain-based multi-tenant architecture where:

- Each tenant gets their own subdomain (`tenant.yourdomain.com`)
- The middleware handles routing requests to the correct tenant
- Tenant data is stored in Redis using a `subdomain:{name}` key pattern
- The main domain hosts the landing page and admin interface
- Subdomains are dynamically mapped to tenant-specific content

The middleware (`middleware.ts`) intelligently detects subdomains across various environments (local development, production, and Vercel preview deployments).

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy

For custom domains, make sure to:

1. Add your root domain to Vercel
2. Set up a wildcard DNS record (`*.yourdomain.com`) on Vercel
